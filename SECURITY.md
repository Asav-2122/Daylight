## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security seriously at Daylight, and we value the communityâ€™s efforts in identifying and reporting vulnerabilities.

### If You Discover a Security Vulnerability:

1. **Do not open a public issue.**  
   Security issues should be disclosed responsibly. Instead, please send an email to [naeemmalikk@icloud.com] with the details of the vulnerability.

2. **Provide as much detail as possible.**  
   Include all relevant information to help us understand and resolve the issue, such as:
   - Vulnerable version number.
   - Steps to reproduce the vulnerability.
   - Impact of the vulnerability (e.g., unauthorized data access, code execution).
   - Suggested remediation (if known).

3. **We will respond promptly.**  
   Upon receiving your report, we will acknowledge the receipt and provide updates as we investigate and fix the issue.

### Security Patch Process:

- Once a vulnerability has been confirmed, we will work on a fix.
- Security patches will be released as soon as possible, usually as part of a patch or minor release.
- We will notify affected users about the security issue and provide guidance on upgrading or applying patches.

## Responsible Disclosure Guidelines

To encourage responsible disclosure, we ask security researchers to:

- **Wait for a fix** before publicly disclosing the vulnerability.
- Give us **reasonable time** to investigate and patch the issue.
- Do not access or modify user data beyond what is necessary to demonstrate the vulnerability.
